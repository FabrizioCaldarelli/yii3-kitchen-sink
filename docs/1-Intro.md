Yii 3 is the second major rewrite of the Yii framework. 

> Originally started in the 2.1 branch, it was later decided to switch to the 3.X series because of all the backward compatibility breakage.


This rewrite addresses a lot of issues Yii 2 suffered from, like the framework being too coupled with jQuery, bower, bootstrap. <small>[TODO: add more grieffs about Yii2]</small>

Starting with 3.0, [Yii will follow the Sementic Versionning](https://www.yiiframework.com/news/177/yii-adopts-semver-since-version-3-0-0).
